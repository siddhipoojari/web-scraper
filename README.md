# **Data Scraping Automation â€“ Internship Project**

## **Overview**
This project was developed as part of my internship with the **Psychedelic Association of Canada**. The goal was to automate the extraction of data from platforms such as **Keela** and **Mailchimp** using **Selenium** and **BeautifulSoup**, and utilize this data to develop email marketing strategies. The script efficiently handles large datasets and streamlines workflow processes.

## **Key Features:**
- Configurable to work with different data structures and platforms.
- Built with **Selenium** for browser automation and **BeautifulSoup** for HTML parsing.

## **Technologies Used:**
- **Selenium**: Automates browser tasks like form submissions, scrolling, and interaction with dynamic elements.
- **BeautifulSoup**: Extracts data from HTML efficiently.
- **Python**: The core programming language for scripting and automation.
